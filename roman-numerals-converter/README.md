## Concept
Convert the given number into a roman numeral.

All roman numerals answers should be provided in upper-case.

## Solution
My solution is simple and understandable. It's definately not the best nor the fastest solution, but it works, so give it a try!

## Methods used
  The only new method in this project is array1.concat(array2) witch creates a new array with the elements from the first and the second array.
