# javascript-algorithms-projects

### Description:
A series of projects on algorithms and data structures from freeCodeCamp.org's course.

### Includes:
In each folder you will find:
  * The .js file with the solution
  * A README with a short explanation

### Recommendation:
If you're interesting in learning about algorithms and data structures, these projects are a good start. Although you shouldn't start by looking at my code, but by visiting [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/) and practicing in their code playground.
  
### Keep in mind:
 freeCodeCamp's policy is against copying code for these projects. I take no responsibility if my code is used by someone to gain the certification. I upload it for educational and self-promoting purposes. Check [freeCodeCamp's academic policy](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/academic-honesty-policy/).
